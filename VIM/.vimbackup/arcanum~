So far paul has had a job stealing a ruby for sammy white and getting a job for an inside job for mr. black. 

He woke up with a matchbook and nothing else. He had to find clothes and a job for money. The matchbook has a symbol on it.
The woman who left it behind is interested in him for his blood, he has a "gene" in it that does something special and she was collecting
a sample.

Recap: when the adventurers arrive on the surface there is pandemonium and dissaray in the town of Tarant. The building is rocked like a flashbang had gone off. the source is a bombing from the group associatecd with the symbol. Air pirates storm the land killing and looting. Work into the story mention of a city across the continent inhabited by pirates with great treasure who are the organized crime of the continent? work from there

The characters have suffered psychological and physical damage after the vicious bombings of and subsequent flight from Tarant. The party was found by soldiers of Cumbria who started an escort to Stillwater. They killed the four soldiers thinking they were in the right when later it was found out that they killed inoccents and began to suffer dramatically. The group made it north to Stillwater after the slayings and recieved information from the town about how to make flying machines and weapons of war. Some scrounged for supplies and Ace acquired an in with the pirates of Scarborough. Ace was told to head north across the mountains towards the elves of Qualinesti. Before they reach the elves the pirates will find him..... The party has thus decided they want to achieve flight and take on the Scarborough pirates and save the world from a hegemony. This could prove to be devastating for the world as there is a war in the midst and the pirates will eventually be proven to be on the side of good, with a plan that might just save the world instead. The party will have to make a choice eventually to join the pirates and save the world going against their initial instincts or dooming the world by helping spread dangerous technology to the empire-wide grudge match between Cumbria and Edron. 

==================================================
Immediate timeline: In the town of Stillwater there are many makers from the kingdom of Cumbria because of a new natural resource that has been discovered in the caves where the Stillwater giant was thought to have lived. This new resource has been capitalized by the Kingdom by protecting and putting the material to use. It is a new type of metal (aluminum) that is stronger and lighter than steel. suitable for aircraft. The lathe is discovered and work has begun to make tunneling machines that will connect the kindom underground in secret, able to carry large amounts of troops long distances in short amounts of time. The prospect of this new material has also spurred a need for weapons of war. Something that the makers will want Malkias character for. Possible abduction**********
